 **Step 1** Overview of Tasks :

This practical assignment focused on learning how to create, delete, and monitor Pluggable Databases (PDBs) using Oracle 21c.
The tasks were divided into three main parts:

Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)

I created a new PDB named od_pdb_28450 using SQL commands.

I also created an administrative user odry_plsqlauca_28450.

The database was successfully created and verified using the SHOW PDBS command.

Task 2: Create and Delete a PDB

Another PDB was created with the name od_to_delete_pdb_28450.

After confirming its creation, I deleted it using the DROP PLUGGABLE DATABASE command.

Screenshots were taken before and after deletion to confirm the process.

Task 3: Configure Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)

I accessed Oracle Enterprise Manager Express (OEM) to manage and monitor the databases.

Although I could not log in using my PDB user, I successfully logged in as the SYSTEM user to view the PDBs.

The OEM dashboard screenshot was taken showing the configuration result.

Overall, the practical helped me understand the creation, deletion, and management of pluggable databases and how to monitor them using OEM Express.
